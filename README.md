# Healthcare-Data-Insights-SQL
This project is a comprehensive Hospital SQL Data Analysis case study where I explored key healthcare metrics using SQL queries. The dataset includes hospital information such as patient count, department details, medical expenses, admission/discharge dates, and more.  The project focuses on extracting meaningful insights through SQL concepts 
🏥 Hospital SQL Data Analysis Project
📌 Overview

This project is a complete SQL-based analysis of hospital data, focusing on extracting meaningful insights from a healthcare dataset. The dataset includes details about hospitals, departments, patients, medical expenses, admission/discharge dates, and more.

Using SQL queries, this project uncovers key performance metrics that support decision-making in hospital operations and healthcare management.

🎯 Objectives

This project aims to:

Analyze patient distribution across hospitals

Evaluate doctor availability

Identify top and low-performing departments

Calculate medical expenses and cost trends

Track patient stay duration

Generate city-wise and monthly insights for management

📂 Project Contents

The analysis includes the following SQL tasks:

1. Total Number of Patients

Calculate patient count across all hospitals.

2. Average Number of Doctors

Find the average doctor count per hospital.

3. Top 3 Departments by Patients

Identify departments with the highest patient load using window functions.

4. Hospital with Maximum Medical Expenses

Determine the hospital spending the most on medical care.

5. Daily Average Medical Expenses

Compute average expenses per day for each hospital.

6. Longest Patient Stay

Calculate longest hospital stay using date functions.

7. Total Patients Per City
